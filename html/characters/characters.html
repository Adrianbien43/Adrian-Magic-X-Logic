              <h3>Nyxiel</h3>
              <p>Nyxiel, a battle angel in a cyberpunk city, discovers that his dark past is linked to the chaos he
                seeks to eliminate. On his mission to stop three philosophers and their leader, Crown of Thorns, he must
                face his own identity and the conflict between magic and logic. The battle for truth and balance will
                test his soul and destiny.</p>

              <p>On a tidal moon dominated by space pirates, Arioth, the battle angel with the power of chains, must
                face Blackbeard, a rogue philosopher who manipulates tides and trapped souls. In a hostile environment
                of chaos and war, Arioth will battle not only his enemy but also the dark truths of his own power. The
                battle for control of the moon will test his morality and the fate of its inhabitants.</p>

              <p>The third battle angel, Zariel, possesses flavor magic, which grants her extraordinary powers by
                consuming different tastes: superhuman strength, agility, speed, invisibility, and more. Her story
                begins on a rocky moon surrounded by towering mountain ranges, where she faces a philosopher who, though
                defeating her, awakens a new determination in her. Defeat will only drive her to discover her magic's
                true potential and destiny.</p>

                a philosopher planning a cosmic genocide. To stop him, she will gather the other battle angels for a
                mission to save the innocent. The fight will be an epic battle for the survival and balance of the

                gloomy gothic city. One of his personalities allows him to manipulate logic, giving him a strategic
                edge. However, he faces the mayor, a philosopher who controls people through knowledge, preventing
                Eryndor from fulfilling his mission.</p>

                ability to carry out attacks on the magical organization, spreading chaos and weakening its key members.
                His goal is to destroy from within, destabilizing the balance between magic and logic.</p>

              <p>This philosopher, known as "Abaddon," was a respected scientist obsessed with achieving godlike power.
                After experimenting on his own body, he lost all humanity, becoming an emotionless, amoral abomination.
                Now, under the control of Crown of Thorns, he is her feared "lapdog," a weapon of destruction executing
                deadly missions to hunt and eliminate battle angels. His lack of humanity makes him an unstoppable
                machine capable of fulfilling any mission without remorse.</p>

              <p>Mordrath is the right hand of Crown of Thorns, a philosopher feared for his blood magic and logic
                capable of bending space at will. With terrifying ease, he can annihilate a battle angel, and his power
                makes him an unstoppable threat. His connection with darkness and chaos makes him a feared figure,
                executing merciless missions and destroying everything in his path.</p>

              <p>Pinella is a living puppet made from the parts of an extinct race, controlled by higher beings and one
                of the most loyal members of Crown of Thorns. With a psychopathic nature, she enjoys torturing and
                killing her victims, especially battle angels, whom she hunts without mercy. Her existence is an
                aberration, a mix of macabre engineering and pure evil, making her an unstoppable and terrifying threat.
